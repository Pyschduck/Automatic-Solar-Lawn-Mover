Project Overview
The Automatic Solar Lawn Mower is an innovative system designed to autonomously mow lawns using solar energy. 🌞 This project aims to create an eco-friendly solution for lawn care by combining solar power with a smart, autonomous mower. 🤖 The project integrates robotics, automation, solar energy, and machine learning to deliver a sustainable lawn care solution. 🌍

Components Used:
Solar Panel 🌞: Powers the mower's motor and electronics.
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32) 💻: Controls the mower’s movements and sensors.
Motors ⚙️: Drive the mower across the lawn.
Ultrasonic Sensors 📡: Detect obstacles and help with navigation.
GPS 📍: Provides precise navigation and positioning.
Battery 🔋: Stores energy from the solar panel for use during non-sunny periods.
Features:
Solar-Powered 🌞: The mower is powered entirely by solar energy, making it an eco-friendly alternative to gas-powered mowers. 🌿
Autonomous Navigation 🚗: Uses sensors and GPS to detect obstacles and efficiently mow the lawn.
Efficient Charging 🔋: Charges during the day and operates autonomously, even on cloudy days.
Repository Contents:
Project Code 💻: The source code for controlling the mower’s hardware and navigation algorithms.
Presentation (PPT) 📊: A PowerPoint presentation explaining the design, working, and components of the mower.
Video Demonstration 🎥: A video showcasing the working prototype of the solar lawn mower in action.
